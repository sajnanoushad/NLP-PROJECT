Preprocessing Steps:

Text Cleaning:

Remove special characters, numbers, and punctuation that do not contribute to the emotional meaning of the text.

Convert all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.

Tokenization:

Split the cleaned text into individual words, which are the basic units for analysis.
Removal of Stopwords:

Stopwords are common words that may not have significant meaning in emotion classification. Using a predefined list from NLP libraries , we will remove these from our tokens.
Impact on Model Performance:

Cleaning the text helps to reduce noise, allowing the model to focus on meaningful words that contribute to the emotional context.

Tokenization simplifies the textual data for further processing.

Removing stopwords enhances computational efficiency and reduces dimensionality, which may lead to improved model performance by emphasizing words that carry more emotional meaning.

Feature Extraction

for extraction use TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction. This method transforms the text data into a matrix of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features.


Model Development

 Naive Bayes:

A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem, suitable for text classification due to its simplicity and efficiency with large datasets.

Support Vector Machine (SVM):

A supervised learning model that can classify data by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes. It works well with high-dimensional data, such as text.

Training the Models

Model Comparison

Evaluation Metrics

For evaluation,use accuracy and F1-score:

Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, which considers both false positives and false negatives—particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.

Model Suitability for Emotion Classification**:

Naive Bayes is fast and efficient for large datasets and works well with text data due to its assumption of feature independence.

SVM, while also effective, may require more computational power but generally provides high accuracy on high-dimensional datasets.

In summary, the choice between models may depend on the size of the dataset and the required interpretability of the results.
